# GranTecanTouchdesignerDemo

Demo project using the data from a observation night.

I developed a component to read the telescope data from a CSV, and then, using an ExectionDAT node, every frame outputs the values in a table (in a loop).

The input for my component is the path of the CSV file.

At the moment, we have the telescope movement, elevation and azimuth, and a couple of weather sensors (temperature, humidity, etc).
